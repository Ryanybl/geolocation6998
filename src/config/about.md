## Project overview

#### Authors: Ryan Liang, Yuezi Wu, Hasan Siddiqui


The project for Cloud Computing and Big Data course (Fall 2021) is motivated by the need to relay the data products to QSEL partners in Sub Saharan Africa. 

Demo for MVP:
Front end for platform
The map tab allows users to view interactive open street map similar to Google Maps
Some imagery products like EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and other products can be layered on top of base maps (this feature is not avialable on Google Maps which do not allow uploading of custom products and hence making this project unique)

Work in progress:
Authentication/Login page
Users can process imagery to create maps such as EVI and land cover classifications by searching for coordinates and highest resolution free imagery available ie. Sentinel 2 at 10m resolution.
The development team should be able to push local development to a Git repository linked to the user interface and introduce new products
The outputs of the tasks would be stored in a data bucket
